I saw you dancing out the ocean
D/C                    G
Running fast along the sand
Gm                         Eb
A spirit born of earth and water
Eb                    F
Fire flying from your hands
Bb                    Eb
In the instant that you love someone
F                       Bb
In the second that the hammer hits
Fm           G
Reality runs up your spine
Cm7                     F
And the pieces finally fit

Bb                    D/C
And all I ever needed was the one
Gm                             Bb
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
F#                      Bb
When stars collide like you and I
    Dm                  Eb
No sha-  dows block the sun
Cm7
You're all I've ever needed
F                   Bb
Baby you're the one

D/C                   C
There are caravans we follow
D/C                      G
Drunken nights in dark hotels
Gm                               Eb
When chances breathe between the silence
Eb                              F
Where sex and love no longer gel

Bb                Eb
For each man in his time is Cain
F               Bb
Until he walks along the beach
Fm                         G
And sees his future in the water
